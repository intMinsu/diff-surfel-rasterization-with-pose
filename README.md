# Differential Surfel Rasterization for Camera Pose Optimization
This repository provides an implementation of a 2D Gaussian rasterizer enhanced with analytic Jacobians for camera pose optimization. The code builds upon the original [2DGS implementation](https://github.com/hbb1/diff-surfel-rasterization) and is used in our CVPR 2025 paper ["4DTAM: Non-rigid Tracking and Mapping via Dynamic Surface Gaussians"](https://muskie82.github.io/4dtam/).

If you find this code helpful in your research, we kindly ask that you cite our work.
